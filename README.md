# PG&E Feed-in Rates

This repository provides PG&E feed-in rate data in JSON format for use with energy management systems like [EVCC](https://evcc.io). The data is particularly useful for PG&E solar customers who want to track their energy usage based on the rates they receive when exporting energy back to the grid.

## Understanding PG&E Feed-in Rates

PG&E's Net Billing Tariff (NBT) provides compensation for solar customers when they export energy back to the grid. Rates are determined by:

- **Vintage Year**: The year you activated your solar system (NBT23, NBT24, etc.)
- **Time of Day**, **Day Type**, and **Month**: Rates vary throughout the day, week, and year
- **Rate Type**: Generation rates vs. Delivery rates

### Vintage Years and Rate Guarantees

Per CPUC Resolution E-5301, each NBT vintage has specific guarantees:

- **NBT23, NBT24, NBT25, NBT26**: Guaranteed export rates for 9 years from Permission-To-Operate (PTO) date
- **NBT00 (Floating Vintage)**: Only rates for 2025 and 2026 are actual effective rates

Any rates beyond the guaranteed period are for illustrative purposes only and not actual effective SBP Export Rates.

### Generation vs. Delivery Rates

PG&E provides two types of feed-in rates:

- **Generation Rates** (USCA-XXPG): Compensation for the energy you generate and export
- **Delivery Rates** (USCA-PGXX): Account for the delivery component of exported energy

For most home solar customers, generation rates are typically most relevant for calculating export compensation.

## JSON File Format

The JSON files adhere to [EVCC's Custom Plugin](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/tariffs#dynamic-electricity-price) format:

1. **File Structure**: Each JSON file contains an array of time-price objects.
2. **Timestamp Format**: All timestamps are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) with the 'Z' suffix, following the ISO 8601 standard:
   * Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
   * Example: `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z`
3. **Object Structure**: Each entry contains three fields:
   * `start`: The beginning of the time period (in UTC)
   * `end`: The end of the time period (in UTC)
   * `price`: The electricity rate in dollars per kilowatt-hour
4. **Time Handling**: EVCC automatically converts the UTC timestamps to the local time zone of your installation, handling daylight saving time transitions properly.

Example:
```json
[
  { "start": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", "end": "2025-01-01T01:00:00Z", "price": 0.05375 },
  { "start": "2025-01-01T01:00:00Z", "end": "2025-01-01T02:00:00Z", "price": 0.04885 }
]
```

EVCC periodically checks these rates (typically once per hour) to determine the current electricity price for your feed-in calculations, allowing for accurate time-of-use pricing.

## Using with EVCC

These JSON files are formatted for [EVCC's tariff system](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/tariffs) for use with the [EVCC Custom Plugin](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/tariffs#dynamic-electricity-price). You can link to the appropriate GitHub raw file and add it to your `evcc.yaml` configuration as follows:

```yaml
tariffs:
  currency: USD
  feedin:
    type: custom
    forecast:
      source: http
      uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielraffel/pge-feed-in-rates/refs/heads/main/2025/NBT24-generation-feed-in-rates.json
```

Select the JSON file that corresponds to your solar activation year and rate type. For example, if your solar system was activated in 2024, use the NBT24-generation-feed-in-rates.json file. Adjust the year as neededâ€”this file, for instance, retrieves 2025 rates.

## Converting Your Own Rates

To convert rates for future vintage years or to re-run the conversion:

1. Navigate to the `utility-rates` directory
2. Run the script: `python convert-rates.py`

The script can process both zipped and unzipped CSV files (prioritizing zipped if both exist), and will automatically:
- Generate files for each vintage according to its appropriate year range
- Create separate generation and delivery rate JSON files
- Organize files by year and store comprehensive archives

The script handles different NBT vintages with appropriate date ranges:
- **NBT00 (Floating Vintage)**: 2025-2026 only
- **NBT23**: 2023-2031 (9 years) *
- **NBT24**: 2024-2032 (9 years) *
- **NBT25**: 2025-2033 (9 years)
- **NBT26**: 2026-2034 (9 years)
- Future vintages can be easily added and mapped to appropriate 9-year periods

* Note: NBT23 and NBT24 only generate files from 2025 onward
